FFX Tools

GENERAL SETUP
Movement keys must be bound to WASD
Confirm, Menu, and Cancel mapped to C, V, X respectively

You can use the 2nd Keyboard settings to set these if they're not your default.



Autofarmer
SETUP: MOVE TO AREA YOU WANT TO FARM
Very simple script that moves Tidus around and holds Confirm in order to AFK farm.


Yuna Party Heals
SETUP: YUNA MUST BE IN 8TH PARTY SLOT
Some people are less inclined to want to "cheat" but just automatically gaining HP indefinitely through the use of the supercharger boost.
For those people, the Yuna Party Heals tool allows you to go from the regular game display in order to heal all 3 current party members.
